	<p>We will get you set up with a unique username and password so can see the back end of our waiver and reservation system in the next day or so.  Once in there, feel free to delete a waiver, edit a reservation, add a new one as admin, etc. Each day we refresh the data, so we will delete any of your entries, and restore any that are deleted.  We will also move the dates of any booked parties each week, so there is a selection of data for people to look at in the admin area.
    </p>
    
    <p>You will see that the Admin can add a reservation for days that are normally not open for business.  You can also look at daily reports, see the chart of activity and more. Some of the sections, are set inactive, so you can't hurt anything... feel free to play!  And again, we refresh all the data each day, and week anyway!  After you have a chance to play around in there, feel free to give us a call if you have any questions!
       </p>
